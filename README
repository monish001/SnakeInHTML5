I am CSE about-to-grad from Thapar University, Patiala. This repository contains the programs I develop in various languages from time to time.
I have explored and worked a number of languages: C/C++, preliminary STL, Java with JDBC and Swing, LISP, HTML, CSS, HTML5, JavaScript, SmartClient, Prolog, PHP, cakePhp, BSD sockets in C.
I am looking forward to explore Android/WindowPhone7 APIs or Hadoop APIs.
